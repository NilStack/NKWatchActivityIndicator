An activity indicator library for Apple Watch and a sample to **push the limits of animation in watchOS 2**. We are trying to implement beautiful indicators in [this fork of DGActivityIndicatorView](https://github.com/ninjaprox/DGActivityIndicatorView) and support ball scale, ball scale ripple, tow dots, three dots, ball zigzag, ball zigzag deflect animations now and will integrate more.
**Static screenshots can't show the animation effect, please make sure see the gif below.**

###Copy NKWatchActivityIndicator folder to watch app extension ###

######Note: because the limition of WatchKit, maybe you need to use similiar UI elements and layouts as we did in demo for some animation effects

##Requirements##
* watchOS ~> 2.0
* Xcode >= 7.0

##Examples##
Add and layout UI elements in storyboard as we did in demo or customize to meet your requirements
Then 
   
    - (void)willActivate {
    // This method is called when watch view controller is about to be visible to user
    [super willActivate];
    
    self.animation = [[NKWActivityIndicatorAnimation alloc] initWithType:NKWActivityIndicatorAnimationTypeBallScale controller:self images:@[self.indicatorImage]];
    
    [self.animation startAnimating];
    }

    - (void)didDeactivate {
    // This method is called when watch view controller is no longer visible
    [super didDeactivate];
    
    [self.animation stopAnimating];

    }


##TODO##
* more testing
* refactoring
* more indicator types
